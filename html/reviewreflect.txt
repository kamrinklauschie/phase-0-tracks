Briefly describe your understanding of what the browser does, including definitions of the following:
There are 2 types of rendering, client side and server side. Client side means on your local machine, server side means remotely.

What is HTML? In your answer, include definitions of the following:
HTML is Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files with font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on web pages. Elements are used to separate different types of objects on the web. There are 2 types of elements, block and inline. Block can be thought of as "bigger" - meaning that block elements hold down the page and inline elements support. Inline elements can live inside block elements. Elements have attributes which tell you more about the specifics of the element. I think of attributes as the rules for elements. To start an HTML file, you use an HTML tag, which is <!DOCTYPE HTML>. A node is any of the elements that connect with other elements. They are the glue in between each element.

Very briefly, explain the purpose of the following elements:
head - a container for metadata
body - major part of
p - paragraph
form - create an interface where the user can provide information to the server
div - division or section
span - group inline elements
select - a form option that allows the user to pick one option from many
h2 - the 2nd most important header
ol - ordered list, think 1, 2, 3
ul - unordered list, think bullet points
table - making an Excel spreadsheet type thing
tr - defines a table row
td - defines a table cell, closes it
