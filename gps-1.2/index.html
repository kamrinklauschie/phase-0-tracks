<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
A semantic tag is used to define the content enclosed after it. It's especially useful for web accessibility for those who might have a disability. Header, footers, images/figures, navigation - all seem like they'd be quite useful.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Sublime is super handy for getting syntax set up right and saving time not writing each individual item. It saves a lot of time and will probably save even more time and effort when I know more things.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
Getting link syntax correct was relatively difficult, but once I did one correctly it was easy to reference it again. Memorizing how tables are set up is also pretty difficult, but I don't think its something I need to know by heart. Overall, version control and committing/making sure I update the right branch in GitHub is still the hardest thing to keep track.
