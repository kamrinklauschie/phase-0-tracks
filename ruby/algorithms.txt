Elevator & Stairs 

Elevator 

Commands
"open elevator door"
"close elevator door"
"go up full speed"
"go down full speed"
"slow down"
"stop"
"each floor of the building"

Sensors 
"door closing" - person inside 
"door opening" - at the right place 

This is complicated and makes my brain want to explode. 


Stairs 

For each step in a case of stairs: 

Left foot -
	- Raise left foot above height of step
	- Raise left foot over the step
	- Step down
	- Shift weight down 

Right foot - 
	- Raise right foot above height of the step 
	- Raise right foot over the step
	- Step down 
	- Shift weight down 

Repeat left foot

Repeat right foot 

If no more steps are present, stop.
